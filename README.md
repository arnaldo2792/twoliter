## ðŸš§ðŸ‘· 

This project is just getting started and is not ready for contributions.
Soon we will be posting a design document and creating GitHub issues.

We welcome ideas and requirements in the form of issues and comments!

## For Maintainers

This section includes information for maintainers about testing and releasing Twoliter.

### Release

A release consists of a semver tag in the form `v0.0.0`.
We also use release-candidate tags in the form `v0.0.0-rc1`.
Release-candidate tags are typically deleted after the release is done.

We use a fork of `cargo-dist` to facilitate binary releases.
The purpose of the `cargo-dist` fork is to enable cross-compilation with `cross`
We do not release Twoliter into `crates.io`.

To perform a release:

- Create a PR that bumps the version and changelog like [this one].
- Push a release-candidate tag, e.g. `v0.0.4-rc1`.
- That will kick of a GitHub Actions workflow that creates a GitHub release and attaches binaries.
- Create a Bottlerocket PR ([example]) that uses the new version of Twoliter.
- Test Twoliter in Bottlerocket
  - `cargo make`
  - `cargo make ami`
  - `cargo make test --help`
  - More extensive testing if needed.
- When it's working merge the Twoliter PR and push a finalized tag, e.g. `v0.0.4`.
- Once the GitHub Actions workflow finishes, update the Bottlerocket PR to your finalized tag.
- Merge the Bottlerocket PR
- Delete your release-candidates and release-candidate tags from the GitHub repository (using the GitHub UI).
